# Azure Xubuntu XRDP Cloud Development Environment

This project provides a **complete cloud-based Linux desktop development environment**
powered by **Xubuntu + XRDP**, **Mini-Active Directory**, and **Azure Files (NFS)** on
the Microsoft Azure platform.

It is designed as a **universal dev workstation** that contains the full superset of
tools, dependencies, and configurations used across all build projects on my channel.

![xrdp](xrdp.png)

Instead of manually configuring a workstation for each tutorial, demo, or cloud
project, this solution automatically provisions:

1. **A Custom Xubuntu XRDP Azure Image (Packer)**
   - Preloaded with Chrome, Firefox (deb), VS Code, Docker, KRDC, Postman
   - Includes all development tooling used across channel projects:
     **Packer, Terraform, Docker CLI, Azure CLI, AWS CLI v2, Google Cloud CLI**
   - Snap-free, clean, lightweight Xfce desktop
   - XRDP fully configured with all fixes, enhancements, and defaults
   - Desktop/panel icons, terminal emulator defaults, and `/etc/skel` customizations

2. **A Mini Active Directory Domain (Terraform)**
   - Samba-based AD Domain Controller running on Azure
   - Domain users generated from a template with friendly passwords
   - Central authentication for Linux and Windows clients

3. **Domain-Joined Xubuntu XRDP VM (Terraform)**
   - Deploys the Xubuntu XRDP instance using the Packer-built Azure Managed Image
   - Automatically joins the Mini-AD domain during boot
   - Ensures consistent user profiles and default settings through `/etc/skel`

4. **Azure Files (Premium NFS) for Persistent Home Directories**
   - Linux instances mount Azure Files via NFS 4.1
   - Provides centralized, persistent, scalable home directories
   - Ideal for multi-VM desktop pools or Azure-based demo environments

The result is a **disposable, reproducible, cloud-hosted Linux workstation** that
can be used for **any build, automation, or cloud project**
featured on the channel.

### Users and Groups

As part of this project, when the domain controller is provisioned, a set of sample **users** and **groups** are automatically created through Terraform-provisioned scripts running on the mini-ad server. These resources are intended for **testing and demonstration purposes**, showcasing how to automate user and group provisioning in a self-managed Active Directory environment.


#### Groups Created

| Group Name    | Group Category | Group Scope | gidNumber |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| mcloud-users  | Security       | Universal   | 10001     |
| india         | Security       | Universal   | 10002     |
| us            | Security       | Universal   | 10003     |
| linux-admins  | Security       | Universal   | 10004     |

#### Users Created and Group Memberships

| Username | Full Name   | uidNumber | gidNumber | Groups Joined                    |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| jsmith   | John Smith  | 10001     | 10001     | mcloud-users, us, linux-admins    |
| edavis   | Emily Davis | 10002     | 10001     | mcloud-users, us                  |
| rpatel   | Raj Patel   | 10003     | 10001     | mcloud-users, india, linux-admins |
| akumar   | Amit Kumar  | 10004     | 10001     | mcloud-users, india               |

#### Understanding `uidNumber` and `gidNumber` for Linux Integration

The **`uidNumber`** (User ID) and **`gidNumber`** (Group ID) attributes are critical when integrating **Active Directory** with **Linux systems**, particularly in environments where **SSSD** ([System Security Services Daemon](https://sssd.io/)) or similar services are used for identity management. These attributes allow Linux hosts to recognize and map Active Directory users and groups into the **POSIX** (Portable Operating System Interface) user and group model.


### Creating a New Desktop User

Follow these steps to provision a new user in the Active Directory domain and validate their access to the Desktop.

1. **Connect to the Domain Controller**  
   - Log into the **`windows-ad-admin`** server via Remote Desktop (RDP).  
   - Use the `rpatel` or `jsmith` credentials that were provisioned during cluster deployment.  

2. **Launch Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**  
   - From the Windows Start menu, open **“Active Directory Users and Computers.”**  
   - Enable **Advanced Features** under the **View** menu. This ensures you can access the extended attribute tabs (e.g., UID/GID mappings).  

3. **Navigate to the Users Organizational Unit (OU)**  
   - In the left-hand tree, expand the domain (e.g., `mcloud.mikecloud.com`).  
   - Select the **Users** OU where all cluster accounts are managed.  

4. **Create a New User Object**  
   - Right-click the Users OU and choose **New → User.**  
   - Provide the following:  
     - **Full Name:** Descriptive user name (e.g., “Mike Cloud”).  
     - **User Logon Name (User Principal Name / UPN):** e.g., `mcloud@mcloud.mikecloud.com`.  
     - **Initial Password:** Set an initial password.

5. **Assign a Unique UID Number**  
   - Open **PowerShell** on the AD server.  
   - Run the script located at:  
     ```powershell
     Z:\azure-xubuntu-xrdp\04-utils\getNextUID.bat
     ```  
   - This script returns the next available **`uidNumber`** to assign to the new account.  

6. **Configure Advanced Attributes**  
   - In the new user’s **Properties** dialog, open the **Attribute Editor** tab.  
   - Set the following values:  
     - `gidNumber` → **10001** (the shared GID for the `mcloud-users` group).  
     - `uid` → match the user’s AD login ID (e.g., `rpatel`).  
     - `uidNumber` → the unique numeric value returned from `getNextUID.ps1`.  

7. **Add Group Memberships**  
   - Go to the **Member Of** tab.  
   - Add the user to the following groups:  
     - **mcloud-users** → grants standard Desktop access.  
     - **us** (or other geographic/departmental group as applicable).  

8. **Validate User on Linux**  
   - Open an **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** session to the **`xubuntu-instance`** instance.  
   - Run the following command to confirm the user’s identity mapping:  
     ```bash
     id mcloud
     ```  
   - Verify that the output shows the correct **UID**, **GID**, and group memberships (e.g., `mcloud-users`).

9. **Validate Desktop Access**  
   - Open the a RDP session to the desktop environment
   - Log in with the new AD credentials.

### Clean Up Infrastructure  

When you are finished testing, you can remove all provisioned resources with:  

```bash
./destroy.sh
```

This will remove all Azure resources created by the project — including the resource group, virtual network, subnets, network security groups, public IPs, NICs, the Xubuntu VM, and any supporting infrastructure. Secrets stored in Azure Key Vault will also be deleted unless a retention policy prevents their removal.
